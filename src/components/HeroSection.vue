        I know just going down the slopes is exciting enough, but this season we're adding an extra
        bit of spice to the mix. Welcome to the games!
        <br />
        We have 3 categories to play in: The Metrics, The Bests, and The Predictions. <br />We are
        starting off on the 29th of November and we will close the season off with an awards
        ceremony at the Slush Cup in April 2026. <br />*TBD, but someone will be be sliding down
        that slush cup slope! <br />Good luck out there!
